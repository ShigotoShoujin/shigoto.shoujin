### Code Style

#### Write self-documenting code
The naming of classes, functions and variables should be enough to self-document what the code is doing.  

#### Similar to google code style, with some changes

##### Class Data Members
Class Data Members have a prefix _ instead of trailing  
Sorting the class members in alphabetical order will put the private/protected members together.

##### Constant Names
ALL_UPPER_CASE
